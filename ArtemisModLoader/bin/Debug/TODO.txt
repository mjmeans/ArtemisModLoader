List of things to do for Artemis Mod Loader:

- Code completion on name for timers

- Spacemap (designer) on Mission Studio

- Add DependsOn for missions.
 
- Meta information for missions.

- merging two different vesselData files and artemis.ini files (especially for handling updates).

- Get the Drag-drop functionality for setting Beam range and arcwidth working.
 The silly thing is just driving me nuts--can't seem to get the math right (too 
 many things interacting with each other when something changes).  I'll get it working sooner or later.

- find any text strings not in resource and move to resource.  This is to prepare for possible multi-lingual support.

- Dress up credits in About to look nicer, including providing links to source of API tools included.

- Re-examine EULA and make sure it covers everything needed.

- Anything else???

Maybe:
- Thom's ship editor integrated with the vesselData editor.  Need Thom's source code to even consider.

- a "simulator" in the Mission Studio.  Not sure if this will even be possible without massive coding,
	but if it can be done, the concept is to simulate the Artemis game on the spacemap to test mission
	scripts.  It will not play the game, but will offer the mission developer a means for triggering various
	events to test what happens and make sure what happens is what the mission developer expected.

- Tooltip over mission commands to show the plain English translation. May be complex to code, so this might
	not get done.
