 The silly thing is just driving me nuts--can't seem to get the math right (too 
 many things interacting with each other when something changes).  I'll get it working sooner or later.

  new commands:
	start_getting_keypresses_from
	end_getting_keypresses_from
    set_ship_text
	if_client_key

	Just used a hex editor on Artemis.exe, and I think I can make an educated guess at all the new commands and conditions.  The trick will be figuring out the attributes, unless I get lucky and Thom updates the documentation (hint, hint).

new commands (at least, these are NOT documented in "mission-file-docs.txt") appear to be the following:
start_getting_keypresses_from
end_getting_keypresses_from
set_ship_text
if_client_key

start_getting_kepresses_from is probably for setting the console to get keystrokes from, so that if_client_key can process the keystrokes (if_client_key is probably like the if_gm_key).  I might be able to guess at the attributes by a little trial and error and a little more hex editor scanning.
